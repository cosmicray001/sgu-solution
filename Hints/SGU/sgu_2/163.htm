<DIV align=left>Once upon a time in a country far away lived a king and he had a 
big kingdom. He was a very wise king but he had one weakness - he could count 
only up to three. <BR>Nevertheless, he did not consider this to be a really 
great drawback, since he had a lot of wizards who could count up to one hundred 
(and some of them, people said, even up to one thousand). But one day the grief 
came to the kingdom as the outnumbering barbarians started to approach from all 
sides. And the king then had to make the most important decision in his life. He 
had to choose which of his sons to make generals that he would send to the 
borders of the country to lead the army. <BR>However, the king knew that though 
some of his sons were smart, just like he was, some of them were quite stupid 
and could only lower army spirits with their wrong decisions. More precisely, he 
knew about each of his sons his mental potential - an integer number ranging 
from minus three to three (remember, that the king could count only up to 
three). He also knew that the chance of his army defeating barbarians was 
proportional to the sum of some powers of mental potentials of those of his sons 
that he would make generals (the power exponent was a positive integer number, 
the same for all his sons and not exceeding three either). Thus he had to choose 
such a combination of his sons to lead the army, that this sum would be maximal 
possible. <BR>However, the king himself could not make all appropriate 
calculations since, for example, the second power (the square) of a number not 
exceeding three could be greater than three, and therefore he asked you, his 
most intelligent wizard, to solve this problem. </DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR><B>Input</B></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The first line of the input file contains the number of the sons 
of the king (integer number less than or equal to one hundred). The second line 
contains the positive integer number not exceeding three, the exponent in the 
formula used to calculate the chance of defeating barbarians. The third line 
contains the list of mental potentials of king's sons - all integer numbers, not 
greater than three by their absolute value. </DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR><B>Output</B></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Output the only number - the maximal possible chance of 
defeating barbarians calculated as the sum described. </DIV>

<DIV align=left>In the first example below the king should choose his first and 
third sons to be the generals. In this case the chance to defeat barbarians, 
which is the sum of cubes of mental potentials of these sons, is eight plus one, 
that is nine. <BR>In the second example sending his son to lead the army causes 
the sum to be negative, thus he should not do it and the sum would be zero.

      <P align=justify></P>
      <P align=justify>Bob really <B>LOVES</B> chocolate. He thinks he never 
      gets enough. Imagine his joy when his parents told him that they would buy 
      him many rectangular chocolate pieces for his birthday. A piece of 
      chocolate is a <B>2x1</B> or <B>1x2</B> rectangle. Bob's parents also 
      bought him a nice birthday cake, which can be imagined as a matrix having 
      <B>M</B> rows and <B>N</B> columns. Some positions on the cake are 
      occupied by candles, the others are empty. Bob's parents asked their son 
      to place as many chocolate pieces as he can on the empty squares on the 
      cake, in such a manner that no two chocolate pieces overlap. However, he 
      would like to keep the chocolate pieces to himself. That's why, he wants 
      to place only a minimal amount of them on the cake and keep the rest. In 
      order not to make Mon and Dad suspicious, Bob wants to place the chocolate 
      pieces in such a way, that no other piece may be placed on the cake (that 
      is, there won't exist any two adjacent empty squares). Find the minimal 
      number of pieces which need to be placed on the cake, so that they do not 
      overlap and no extra piece may be added. </P>
      <P align=justify></P><B>
      <P align=justify>Input</P></B>
      <P align=justify>The first line of the input contains <B>2</B> integers: 
      <B>M</B> (<B>1&lt;=M&lt;=70</B>) and <B>N</B> (<B>1&lt;=N&lt;=7</B>). 
      Next, <B>M</B> lines will follow, each of them containing <B>N</B> 
      characters, describing the cake. The character on row <B>i </B>and column 
      <B>j </B>of the cake may be either a <B><TT>'*'</TT> </B>(ASCII code 
      <B>42</B><TT>)</TT>, representing a candle, or a<B><TT> '.' 
      </TT></B>(ASCII code <B>46</B>), representing an empty square. </P>
      <P align=justify></P><B>
      <P align=justify>Output</P></B>
      <P align=justify>You should output one integer: the minimal amount of 
      pieces of chocolate which need to be placed on the cake. </P>

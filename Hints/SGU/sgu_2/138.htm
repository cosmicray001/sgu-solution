      <P align=justify></P>
      <P align=justify><B>N</B> friends gathered in order to play chess, 
      according to the following rules. In the first game, two of the <B>N</B> 
      friends will play. In the second game, the winner of the first game will 
      play against another friend (maybe even the same friend who lost the first 
      game). In the third game, the winner of the second game will play against 
      someone else and so on.. No game will end as a draw (tie). Given the 
      number of games each of the <B>N</B> friends played, find a schedule for 
      the games, so that the above rules are obeyed. </P>
      <P align=justify></P><B>
      <P align=justify>Input</P></B>
      <P align=justify>The first line contains the number of friends <B>N</B> 
      (<B>2&lt;=N&lt;=100</B>). The second line contains <B>N</B> integers, 
      separated by blanks, representing the number of games each friend played. 
      The first number represents the number of games played by the first 
      friend, the second number represents the number of games played by the 
      second friend and so on.. </P>
      <P align=justify></P><B>
      <P align=justify>Output</P></B>
      <P align=justify>The first line should contain the number of games played 
      by all the friends (it will be an integer between <B>1</B> and <B>10 
      000</B>, for every test case). Let's suppose this number is <B>G</B>. 
      Then, <B>G</B> lines follow, each of them containing two integers, 
      describing the games. The first line contains the numbers of the two 
      friends who played the first game. The friend printed first is considered 
      to be the winner. Each of the next <B>G-1</B> lines contain the integers 
      <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>, where <B>a&lt;&gt;b</B> and <B>a</B> or <B>b</B> is 
      the winner of the previous game. The friend printed first on the line is 
      considered to be the winner of the game. <BR>It is guaranteed that for 
      every test case there will be at least one possible scheduling of the 
      games. </P>

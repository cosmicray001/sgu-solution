<DIV align=left>The kingdom of Farland has N cities connected by M roads. Some 
roads are paved with stones, others are just country roads. Since paving the 
road is quite expensive, the roads to be paved were chosen in such a way that 
for any two cities there is exactly one way to get from one city to another 
passing only the stoned roads. <BR><BR>The kingdom has a very strong bureaucracy 
so each road has its own ordinal number ranging from 1 to M: the stoned roads 
have numbers from 1 to N-1 and other roads have numbers from N to M. Each road 
requires some money for support, i-th road requires c<SUB>i</SUB> coins per year 
to keep it intact. Recently the king has decided to save some money and keep 
financing only some roads. Since he wants his people to be able to get from any 
city to any other, he decided to keep supporting some roads in such a way, that 
there is still a path between any two cities. <BR><BR>It might seem to you that 
keeping the stoned roads would be the good idea, however the king did not think 
so. Since he did not like to travel, he did not know the difference between 
traveling by a stoned road and travelling by a muddy road. Thus he ordered you 
to bring him the costs of maintaining the roads so that he could order his 
wizard to choose the roads to keep in such a way that the total cost of 
maintaining them would be minimal. <BR><BR>Being the minister of communications 
of Farland, you want to help your people to keep the stoned roads. To do this 
you want to fake the costs of maintaining the roads in your report to the king. 
That is, you want to provide for each road the fake cost of its maintaining 
d<SUB>i</SUB> in such a way, that stoned roads form the set of roads the king 
would keep. However, to lower the chance of being caught, you want the value of 
sum(i = 1..M, |c<SUB>i</SUB>-d<SUB>i</SUB>|) to be as small as possible. 
<BR><BR>You know that the king's wizard is not a complete fool, so if there is 
the way to choose the minimal set of roads to be the set of the stoned roads, he 
would do it, so ties are allowed. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR><B>Input</B></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The first line of the input file contains N and M (2 &#8804; N &#8804; 60, 
N-1 &#8804; M &#8804; 400). Next M lines contain three integer numbers a<SUB>i</SUB>, 
b<SUB>i</SUB> and c<SUB>i</SUB> each — the numbers of the cities the road 
connects (1 &#8804; a<SUB>i</SUB> &#8804; N, 1 &#8804; b<SUB>i</SUB> &#8804; N, a<SUB>i</SUB> &#8800; 
b<SUB>i</SUB>) and the cost of maintaining it (1 &#8804; c<SUB>i</SUB> &#8804; 10 000). 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR><B>Output</B></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Output M lines — for each road output d<SUB>i</SUB> that should 
be reported to be its maintainance cost so that he king would choose first N-1 
roads to be the roads to keep and the specified sum is minimal possible.

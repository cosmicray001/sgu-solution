      <P align=justify>Dominoes Ц game played with small, rectangular blocks of 
      wood or other material, each identified by a number of dots, or pips, on 
      its face. The blocks usually are called bones, dominoes, or pieces and 
      sometimes men, stones, or even cards.<BR>The face of each piece is 
      divided, by a line or ridge, into two squares, each of which is marked as 
      would be a pair of dice...</P>
      <P align=justify>The principle in nearly all modern dominoes games is to 
      match one end of a piece to another that is identically or reciprocally 
      numbered.</P></EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">

      <P align=justify>Given a set of domino pieces where each side is marked 
      with two digits from 0 to 6. Your task is to arrange pieces in a line such 
      way, that they touch through equal marked sides. It is possible to rotate 
      pieces changing left and right side.</P>
      <P align=justify></P><B>
      <P align=justify>Input</P></B>
      <P align=justify>The first line of the input contains a single integer 
      <EM>N</EM> (1 &#8804; <EM>N</EM> &#8804; 100) representing the total number of pieces 
      in the domino set. The following <EM>N</EM> lines describe pieces. Each 
      piece is represented on a separate line in a form of two digits from 0 to 
      6 separated by a space.</P>

      <P align=justify>Output</P></B>
      <P align=justify>Write УNo solutionФ if it is impossible to arrange them 
      described way. If it is possible, write any of way. Pieces must be written 
      in left-to-right order. Every of N lines must contains number of current 
      domino piece and sign У+Ф or У-У (first means that you not rotate that 
      piece, and second if you rotate it).</P>
